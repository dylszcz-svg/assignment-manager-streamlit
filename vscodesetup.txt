Do this once inside VS Code:

Open the project folder.

Press Cmd + Shift + P.

Type Python: Select Interpreter.

Choose the interpreter that looks like:   .venv/bin/python

From that point on:

Every new terminal VS Code opens for this project will auto-activate .venv

The Python extension will run scripts using that environment

Warnings about paths quietly disappear
